# n-days-of-web

This repo is a way for me to be able to practise and learn web everyday. Each day I will try to work upon a new concept or exercise and document the same in this repo. Details of each day's tasks can be explored in the individual day's sub-directory.

## Index

- [Day 1 (27/08/24)](/Day-1/) - Practised some CSS flexbox basics by going through MDN docs and implementing a simple sandbox to play around with different flexbox properties.
